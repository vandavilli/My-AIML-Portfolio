### Overview
The main objective of the application is to study & analyze the various classifiers like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree to choose the best model to analyze the dataset. The dataset used for this analysis is a Bank dataset which captures responses from a telemarketing campaign targetting customers with a high-yield term deposit. Please find below link to a jupyter notebook containing the necessary technical analysis of the dataset.

I have tried to use open source packages from YellowBrick to visualize classification reports, use of open source packages like missingno to view missing values in the dataset, pandas profiling packages to view the pandas dataset & produce HTML reports & many other useful open source libraries. The attempt is to demonstrate how these packages can be used for EDA, model development & analysis with a couple of lines of code.

### Data Analysis
The first stage of any modelling is data analysis. I used pandas profiler to generate EDA report ( full report embedded in the note book ). Eg. shown below

The advantage of using pandas profiler is with a few lines of code, a significant amount of analytical data gets generated for easy consumption & distribution. Less code implies more attention towards analysis & presentation of data to the stake holders.
