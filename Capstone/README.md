#### Executive summary
As the world's largest diabetes community, it is about real people sharing their experiences and speaking with people in similar positions. Within the platform, patients evaluate their medications at regular intervals, share their own opinions on the use of medicine in the real world, and report more structured data such as side effects, adherence, efficacy, and the burden of using medications. These kinds of message boards are standard & a lot of authentic information gets shared in these kinds of message boards. However, the content is highly unstructured with different writing styles, but the information is very original because it is reported by a person seeking help. Data quantity is not an issue because these message boards bring in a lot of data from diverse population segments. The information posted can range from text-based information to attachments ( purely constrained by the message board's technology ). I also argue that AI Bots, using sentiment analysis, help filter out relevant posts ( especially if the focus is the study of a particular drug - e.g., Metformin here & not insulin ). The information can be further classified using classification algorithms before bringing in an SME for more analysis. 

A sample post like this is a standard post, but a lot of information can be collected using a properly tuned NLP algorithm ...  Hi all, yes I've been diagnosed with diabetes2, it's a bit of a shock to the system and looking to blame anything except myself. I keep in moderate shape as I have a physical job, and I do watch what I eat, so where have I gone wrong? There is no generic links. I have been put on Metformin and now just started my second week taking 1000mg a day.   Along with a lot of valuable, insightful information, what can be of interest to drug companies is how an NLP algorithm can gather data about the use of the drug "Metformin." In this case, an NLP algorithm can extract drug information and make some inferences ...  
	- Newly diagnosed patient using Metformin ( 1000 mg once a day )  Any medical procedure or medication can have unintended consequences. Continuing to monitor these message boards, study the reported symptoms, and prevent these effects is essential to making sure the drug acts as intended. Use of NLP to research and monitor message boards on the effects of Metformin & diabetes monitoring can be extended for more advanced tracking and study of other types of diseases.
