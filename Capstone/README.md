#### Executive Summary
This project aims to enhance the identification and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs) through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing 5,000 annotated pharmacovigilance events from medical case reports, the project seeks to improve ADE categorization and knowledge.

#### Rationale
Pharmacovigilance plays a crucial role in monitoring medication safety, protecting patients, ensuring regulatory compliance, and improving healthcare quality.

#### Research Question
The project focuses on improving the detection and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs) to enable effective risk management strategies and enhance patient safety. It aims to streamline pharmacovigilance processes, regulatory reporting, and the development of safer medications. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the project aims to enhance ADE detection, classification, and understanding, providing valuable data-driven insights for pharmacovigilance.

#### Data Sources
- [PHEE: A Dataset for Pharmacovigilance Event Extraction from Text](https://zenodo.org/record/7689970#.ZF1X3-zMLnQ)

#### Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology for Pharmacovigilance NLP analysis:

1. Business Understanding
   - Define research questions, goals, and success criteria.

2. Data Understanding
   - Gather and explore relevant data sources.

3. Data Preparation
   - Preprocess data using NLP techniques.

4. Modeling
   - Develop NLP models for AE and PTE detection and classification.

5. Evaluation
   - Assess model performance using evaluation metrics.

6. Deployment (Outside the scope of the capstone project)

7. Monitoring (Outside the scope of the capstone project)

#### Results
- Will add more notes as the model matures.

#### Next Steps
Tasks for Future Enhancements:
1. Refine Multi-Event Subset Detection
   - Improve detection and classification of multi-event cases.
   - Consider refining labeling criteria.

2. Integrate Contextual Information
   - Incorporate patient demographics, medical history, and treatment regimens.

## Outline of the Project

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/vandavilli/BH-PCMLAI-VA/blob/main/Capstone/pharmacovigilance-main/eda.ipynb)
   - Perform an in-depth analysis of the Pharmacovigilance dataset.

2. [Sentiment Analysis Model](https://github.com/vandavilli/BH-PCMLAI-VA/blob/main/Capstone/pharmacovigilance-main/model.ipynb)
   - Develop a sentiment analysis model to analyze sentiments in the dataset.

3. [Classification Reports & Scoring Metrics](https://github.com/vandavilli/BH-PCMLAI-VA/blob/main/Capstone/pharmacovigilance-main/scoring.ipynb)
   - Evaluate the model's performance using classification reports and scoring metrics.
