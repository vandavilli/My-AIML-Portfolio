#### Executive summary
This summary provides an overview of a Pharmacovigilance project utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for enhanced identification and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs). By analyzing 5,000 annotated pharmacovigilance events from medical case reports, the project aims to improve ADE categorization and knowledge. The utilization of NLP facilitates more efficient analysis and deeper insights into pharmacovigilance data.

#### Rationale
Pharmacovigilance is essential for proactively monitoring the safety of medications, protecting patients from potential harm, ensuring regulatory compliance, and continuously improving the overall quality of healthcare.

#### Research Question
Pharmacovigilance has significant implications for various stakeholders, including drug safety agencies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, and patients. By improving the detection and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs), it enables the implementation of more effective risk management strategies and early intervention to enhance patient safety. Moreover, the project aims to streamline pharmacovigilance processes and regulatory reporting, contributing to the development of safer medications. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the project seeks to enhance ADE detection, classification, and understanding, thereby providing valuable data-driven insights for the field of pharmacovigilance. Continuous monitoring and analysis of reported symptoms and adverse effects are crucial for ensuring the intended efficacy of medical procedures and medications.
