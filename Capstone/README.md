#### Executive Summary
This project aims to enhance pharmacovigilance through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for improved identification and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs). By analyzing 5,000 annotated pharmacovigilance events from medical case reports, the project aims to enhance ADE categorization and knowledge, leveraging NLP for more efficient analysis and deeper insights.

#### Rationale
Pharmacovigilance plays a crucial role in monitoring medication safety, protecting patients from harm, ensuring regulatory compliance, and improving overall healthcare quality.

#### Research Question
This project focuses on improving the detection and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs) to enable more effective risk management strategies, early interventions, and enhanced patient safety. Additionally, it aims to streamline pharmacovigilance processes and regulatory reporting, contributing to the development of safer medications. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the project seeks to enhance ADE detection, classification, and understanding, providing valuable data-driven insights for pharmacovigilance.

#### Data Sources
- [PHEE: A Dataset for Pharmacovigilance Event Extraction from Text](https://zenodo.org/record/7689970#.ZF1X3-zMLnQ)

#### Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM Methodology for Pharmacovigilance NLP Analysis:

1. Business Understanding:
In the initial stage of my pharmacovigilance NLP analysis project, I aimed to understand the business objectives. I identified the need to distinguish between Adverse Events (AEs) and Potential Therapeutic Events (PTEs) to gain a comprehensive understanding of medication effects. I defined the research questions, goals, and success criteria for the analysis.

2. Data Understanding:
In this phase, I gathered and explored relevant data sources such as medical case reports, electronic health records, and social media. I assessed the quality, completeness, and availability of the data required for identifying AEs and PTEs. Through data exploration techniques, I gained insights into the structure, characteristics, and patterns within the data.

3. Data Preparation:
To prepare the data for analysis, I performed data preprocessing tasks using NLP techniques. This included text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization to standardize the textual data. I leveraged named entity recognition and classification models to identify mentions of AEs and PTEs. By applying semantic analysis, I extracted relevant features and attributes associated with both AE and PTE mentions.

4. Modeling:
In this phase, I utilized various NLP algorithms and techniques to develop models for AE and PTE detection and classification. I employed supervised learning approaches to train and validate the models using annotated data. These models helped in the accurate identification and categorization of AEs and PTEs, allowing for a thorough analysis of medication effects.

5. Evaluation:
The evaluation phase involved assessing the performance and effectiveness of the developed models for AE and PTE identification. I employed evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's accuracy and robustness. Through iterative evaluation, I refined the models and algorithms to improve their performance and reliability.

6. Deployment: ** Outside the scope of the capstone project **
Once the models were successfully evaluated, the next step is to deploy these models for practical use in the pharmacovigilance process.

7. Monitoring: ** Outside the scope of the capstone project **
The final phase of the CRISP-DM methodology requires continuously monitoring and evaluating the performance of the deployed models. Outputs generated by the models are analyzed, identify any potential issues or challenges, and make necessary adjustments to ensure their ongoing effectiveness. This iterative monitoring process ensures that the pharmacovigilance NLP analysis remains up-to-date and aligned with changing data and business requirements.

#### Results
The project is ongoing, and additional results will be added as the model matures.

#### Next Steps
Future enhancements include:
1. Refining multi-event subset detection.
2. Integrating contextual information such as patient demographics and medical history.

These improvements will contribute to a more accurate and comprehensive analysis of ADEs and PTEs in pharmacovigilance.
