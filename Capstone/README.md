#### Executive Summary
This project aims to enhance pharmacovigilance through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for improved identification and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs). By analyzing 5,000 annotated pharmacovigilance events from medical case reports, the project aims to enhance ADE categorization and knowledge, leveraging NLP for more efficient analysis and deeper insights.

#### Rationale
Pharmacovigilance plays a crucial role in monitoring medication safety, protecting patients from harm, ensuring regulatory compliance, and improving overall healthcare quality.

#### Research Question
This project focuses on improving the detection and understanding of adverse drug events (ADEs) to enable more effective risk management strategies, early interventions, and enhanced patient safety. Additionally, it aims to streamline pharmacovigilance processes and regulatory reporting, contributing to the development of safer medications. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the project seeks to enhance ADE detection, classification, and understanding, providing valuable data-driven insights for pharmacovigilance.

#### Data Sources
- [PHEE: A Dataset for Pharmacovigilance Event Extraction from Text](https://zenodo.org/record/7689970#.ZF1X3-zMLnQ)

#### Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM Methodology for Pharmacovigilance NLP Analysis:

1. Business Understanding:
   - Define research questions, goals, and success criteria for the analysis.
2. Data Understanding:
   - Gather and explore relevant data sources, assessing quality and availability.
3. Data Preparation:
   - Preprocess data using NLP techniques, including text cleaning and normalization.
   - Apply named entity recognition and classification models to identify ADE and PTE mentions.
4. Modeling:
   - Develop NLP models for AE and PTE detection and classification using supervised learning approaches.
5. Evaluation:
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Refine models iteratively.
6. Deployment:
   - Deploy models for practical use in pharmacovigilance processes.
7. Monitoring:
   - Continuously monitor and evaluate model performance, making necessary adjustments.

#### Results
The project is ongoing, and additional results will be added as the model matures.

#### Next Steps
Future enhancements include:
1. Refining multi-event subset detection.
2. Integrating contextual information such as patient demographics and medical history.

These improvements will contribute to a more accurate and comprehensive analysis of ADEs and PTEs in pharmacovigilance.
