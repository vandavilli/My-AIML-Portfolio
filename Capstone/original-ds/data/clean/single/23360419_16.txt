Lacosamide pharmacokinetics were consistent with those observed in previous studies of lacosamide alone, with values for AUC of 113.5 ± 20.7 μg h/ml, Cmax of 13.8 ± 2.2 μg/ml, and tmax of 1.1 ± 0.4 h.
Lacosamide and an OC containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel have low potential for drug-drug interaction; therefore, coadministration of the two drugs is unlikely to result in contraceptive failure or loss of seizure control.
